# thought process that used to write the program
After reading the description, I divided the whole program into three big steps: input, process, output.
Inside each steps I also separate into small steps.

1. Input
1.1
The first small step is to use the input function to ask for the user about the system he/she want to use,
and set the 'original_unit' variable equal to this input.

1.2
The second small step is to use the input function as well to ask for the basic quantities I need to use, which include
distance driven and the amount of gasoline was used,
and set two variables for these two quantities,
which name 'distance_quantity_original' and 'gasoline_quantity_original'.

2. Process
I use the if-else statement to convert the quantity provided by the user in the other units system,
calculate the fuel consumption in both units, and get the rating information

2.1
If the original unit is USC

2.1.1
I converted the quantities in USC unit into quantities in Metric unit.
Therefore, we need to set two new variables to be 'distance_quantity_convert_Metric' 'gasoline_quantity_convert_Metric'
with the given mathematical conversion equations:
distance_quantity_Metric = 1.60934 * distance_quantity_USC
gasoline_quantity_Metric = 3.78541 * gasoline_quantity_USC

2.1.3
Then use 'distance_quantity_original' and 'gasoline_quantity_original' variables
to calculate the 'consumption_quantity_USC' by the given formula.
And use  'distance_quantity_convert' and 'gasoline_quantity_convert' variables
to calculate the 'consumption_quantity_Metric' by the given formula

2.2
If the condition is not true, it goes to else statement.

2.2.2
I need to convert the quantities in Metric unit into quantities in USC unit.
The mathematical conversion equations will be
distance_quantity_USC = 0.621371 * distance_quantity_Metric
gasoline_quantity_USC = 0.264172 * gasoline_quantity_Metric

2.2.3
Then use 'distance_quantity_USC' and 'gasoline_quantity_USC' variables
to calculate 'consumption_quantity_USC' by the given formula.
And use  'distance_quantity_Metric' and 'gasoline_quantity_Metric' variables
to calculate 'consumption_quantity_Metric' by the given formula

2.3
I use the if statement to get the rating
if consumption_quantity_Metric > 20:
   Rating = input('extremely poor')
elif consumption_quantity_Metric > 15 and consumption_quantity_Metric <= 20:
   Rating = input('poor')
elif consumption_quantity_Metric > 10 and consumption_quantity_Metric <= 15:
   Rating = input('average')
elif consumption_quantity_Metric > 8 and consumption_quantity_Metric <= 10:
    Rating = input('Good')
else
    Rating = input('Excellent')

3. Output
3.1
Use print funtion to print all the variables
print(distance_quantity_USC)
print(distance_quantity_Metric)
print(gasoline_quantity_USC)
print(gasoline_quantity_Metric)
print(consumption_quantity_USC)
print(consumption_quantity_Metric)
print(Rating)

3.2
Format the variables
