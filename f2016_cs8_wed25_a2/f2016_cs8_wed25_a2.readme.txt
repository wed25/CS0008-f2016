Since the goal of this program is to ask users to enter the name of a text file indefinitely,
I use while(true) loop to execute the main process indefinitely
And I also define two functions before while loop to help execute the process of processing file and formatting result


1. processFile function
At the beginning, I define processFile function

1.1 Define global variables
I declare total_total_counter and total_total_distance as two global variables at first

1.2 Define function
1.2.1 Opening a File
I use the open function in Python to open a file
file_object is the name of variable that will reference the file object
the mode the file will be opened is reading

1.3.2 Printing words
Then I call back printKV function, which I will define it below, to print the words 'File to be read' with the file name

1.3.3 using for loop to accumulate counting number
First I initialize two variables, which are partial_total_counter and partial_total_distance.
Then I use for loop to do the counting process
The variable 'partial_total_counter' will accumulate one to itself each time.
The variable 'partial_total_distance' will accumulate new distance data to itself.
When reading each line, split the data in a line to read distance value.
After that I also strip the new lines from the field and change string type to float type
After finishing reading all lines in the file, I close the file

1.3.4 accumulate total counter and total distance
After accumulating numbers of partial counter and partial distance for each file, I also accumulate total counter
and total distance for all files

1.4 return data
At the end of the function, the function will return two variables outside this function.
The first data is how many lines the file has
The second one is the total distance of each record

2. Define printKV(key,value,klen=0) function
Before declare the main process, I also define another function
This function is to format results

2.1 initialize value
First, I initialize the value of variable 'Value_format'.
This variable is to format value I got from processFile function

2.2 Define the format of key and value
I define key_format variable to format the key words before values
I let all key words have left alignment, and also restrict the max length of keywords to be 25

I also define Value_format to format values
Since the values will be one of three types, which are string, integer, and float,
I use isinstance function to category these three types and format them.
I also use if-elif logic to category these three conditions, which are written by isinstance function
If the value is string type, I restrict the length of it to be 20 spaces long
If the value is float type, I restrict the length of it to be 10 spaces long with 3 decimals
If the value is integer type, I restrict the length of it to be 10 spaces long

2.3 print
After define two variables - 'Value_format' and 'key_format', I use print function to print them together in a line

2.4 return
At the end the function, since there is no requirement to return variables, I just leave return at the end

3. while(true) loop
I use while(true) statement,
since while statement takes an expression and executes the loop body while the expression evaluates to boolean 'true'.
'true' always evaluates to boolean 'true' and thus executes the loop body indefinitely

3.1 input file name
I assign the input of file name to variable "file_name", and ask the user to enter the file name

3.2 if-else to check whether the users want to quit the program
Then I define three variables of conditions in order to check whether users want to stop counting datas in the files.
The three conditions are 'condition1 = "" ', 'condition2 = "quit" ', 'condition3 = 'q''.
If file_name satisfies one of conditions,
the program will stop and print the total accumulated number of lines and total distance run of all files
I use printKV function to print the key words of introducing these values and these accumulated values at the end

If file_name does not satisfy any of those conditions,
it will go to else and call back processFile function to accumulate the counting number inside each files
And I use printKV to print partial total number of lines and partial total distance run for each files

This process will keep going indefinitely
