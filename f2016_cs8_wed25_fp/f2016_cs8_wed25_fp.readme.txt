1. open the master input list to read the name of the file

inside each file,
I first recall the processFile function to calculate the total number of lines and distance

I call the List function to calculate the total multiple record 

2.3
I recall the Max_Min function to determine the max and min distance in the list
used participant object to store all participants information and retrieve by method


3. After read individual line in the list, I create output csv file reporting name of participants,
how many time the name appears in the input files and the total distance run
