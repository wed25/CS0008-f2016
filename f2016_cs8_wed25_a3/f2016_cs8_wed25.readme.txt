1. open the master input list to read the name of the file
2. use the while loop to open each file in the list
2.1
inside each file,
I first recall the processFile function to calculate the total number of lines and distance

2.2
I use the if statement to check it is the first to appear in the list or not.
If it is the first time, the total_multiple_record will accumulate one time
The total distance of each individual will also accumulate from its old distance

2.3
I also recall the Max_Min function to determine the max and min distance in the list

3. After read individual line in the list, I create output csv file reporting name of participants,
how many time the name appears in the input files and the total distance run
